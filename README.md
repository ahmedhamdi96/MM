## Project Overview
*GUC, Winter 2017, CSEN704*

This is a simple chatbot android application that provides movies information. It provides information about movies, actors/actresses, and recommendations based on a movie provided by the user. It contacts the [MM-API](https://github.com/ahmedhamdi96/moviemood), which contacts the [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en) API. The functionalities are provided by using the following commands:

* Movie [MOVIE_NAME] 
> provides information about given movie

* Actor/Actress [ACTOR_NAME/ACTRESS_NAME] 
> provides information about given actor/actress and their popular movies

* Favourite [MOVIE_NAME] 
> provides movies recommendations based on the given movie
